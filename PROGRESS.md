- [x] Benefits mapping from product keys

### ✅ API Endpoints (100%)
- [x] `POST /api/request-access` - Magic link generation
- [x] `GET /api/verify` - Token validation and redirect
- [x] `GET /api/roi` - Complete ROI data (server endpoint)
- [x] `GET /api/roi/ui` - UI-optimized ROI data
- [x] `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

### ✅ Frontend (100%)
- [x] Clean, responsive landing page for email entry
- [x] ROI dashboard with metrics cards
- [x] Recent invoices table with status indicators
- [x] Recent payments table with method details
- [x] Benefits visualization with product mapping
- [x] Error handling and loading states

### ✅ Data Management (100%)
- [x] Configurable pricebook.json for list prices
- [x] Benefits.json for product-to-benefits mapping  
- [x] Plan rules.json for pricing calculations
- [x] JSON file validation and error handling

### ✅ Testing Suite (100%)
- [x] Unit tests for ROI service edge cases
- [x] API endpoint testing with mocked dependencies
- [x] Edge case coverage (no invoices, no payments, multiple contacts)
- [x] Authentication flow testing
- [x] Error scenario testing

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Express.js**: Lightweight, well-documented, perfect for this scope
- **Magic Links**: Secure, no password storage needed, email-based access
- **Server-side API calls**: All Invoice Ninja communication server-side for security
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse while allowing normal usage patterns
- **Single-page app**: Minimal frontend, fast loading, focused on data presentation

### Security Measures Implemented
- All Invoice Ninja API calls happen server-side only
- API token never exposed to client
- Email addresses hashed in logs (16-char SHA256 prefix)
- Magic links expire in 15 minutes and are single-use
- Rate limiting on all public endpoints
- HTTPS security headers via Helmet
- Input validation on all endpoints

### Data Flow
1. User enters email → magic link generated
2. Magic link sent (console output in dev)
3. User clicks link → token validated → redirected to dashboard
4. Dashboard loads ROI data via authenticated API
5. Server queries Invoice Ninja API with stored credentials
6. ROI calculations performed and returned to UI

## Next Steps for Pickup

### Immediate Tasks (Next Session)
1. **Install Dependencies & Test**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with real Invoice Ninja credentials
   npm test
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Set up environment variables in production
   - Configure email service (currently console output)
   - Set up SSL/HTTPS
   - Configure reverse proxy if needed

3. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Real email service integration (NodeMailer/SendGrid)
   - Client-specific branding
   - Export functionality (PDF reports)
   - Invoice Ninja webhook integration for real-time updates

### Configuration Needed
- Invoice Ninja base URL and API token
- Email service configuration (if not using console output)
- Production domain for magic link generation

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test with real Invoice Ninja instance
- [ ] Verify client search works with actual emails
- [ ] Confirm invoice/payment data loads correctly
- [ ] Test magic link flow end-to-end
- [ ] Validate ROI calculations with known data
- [ ] Test rate limiting behavior
- [ ] Verify error handling with invalid tokens
